Swift SDK for [Contentful's][1] Content Delivery API.

[Contentful][1] is a content management platform for web applications, mobile apps and connected devices. It allows you to create, edit & manage content in the cloud and publish it anywhere via powerful API. Contentful offers tools for managing editorial teams and enabling cooperation between organizations.

The Contentful Swift SDK hasn't reached 1.0, yet, but provides a much nicer API than using the [Objective-C SDK][4] from Swift. If you need some of the more advanced features, like [offline persistence][5] using Core Data, you have to stick to the Objective-C SDK for now. Check out our [Swift example][6] in this case.

## Usage


```swift
let client = Client(spaceIdentifier: "cfexampleapi", accessToken: "b4c0n73n7fu1")
client.fetchEntry("nyancat") { (result) in
    switch result {
        case let .Success(entry):
            print(entry)
        case .Error(_):
            print("Error!")
    }
}
```

## Documentation

For further information, check out the [Developer Documentation][3].

## Swift Versioning

The Contentful Swift SDK requires, at minimum, Swift 2.2 and therefore Xcode 7.3.

 Swift version | Compatible Contentful tag |
| --- | --- |
| Swift 3.0 | `v0.3.0` |
| Swift 2.3 | `v0.2.2`|
| Swift 2.2 | `v0.2.1`|

## Installation

Contentful can be installed with either CocoaPods or Carthage depending on your preference.

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods][2] is a dependency manager for Swift, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like the Contentful Delivery API in your projects.

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
pod 'Contentful'
```

You an also specify a specific version depending on your needs. 

```ruby
pod 'Contentful', '0.2.1' 
```

To learn more about operators for dependency versioning within a Podfile, see the [CocoaPods doc on the Podfile][7].

### Carthage

You can also use [Carthage][8] for integration by adding this to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "contentful/contentful.swift" ~> 0.3.0
```
